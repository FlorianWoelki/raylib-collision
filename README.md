# Raylib-Collision

## What is it?

Raylib-Collision is a simple 2D collision detection and resolution library.
Collision is a pretty straightforward task and easy to implement. However, there is no state of the art library that detects the collision and, if you want to, handles it for you as well.

Raylib-Collision is not something like Box2D or other physics framework where you just need to outline the e.g. tilemap. No, you can easily add polygons or rectangles for your tilemap and this library does the rest for you.
